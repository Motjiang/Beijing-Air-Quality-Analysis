# Beijing Air Quality Dashboard

## Project Overview
The Beijing Air Quality Dashboard is designed to provide a comprehensive visualization of air quality data in Beijing, enabling stakeholders to analyze key environmental indicators and trends across various dimensions. This dashboard helps in making informed decisions regarding environmental policies by offering insights into pollutant levels, seasonal variations, and specific events affecting air quality.

## Data Source
The data used in this dashboard is sourced from AirQualityUCI.xlsx. It includes detailed records of various air pollutants, covering attributes such as NOx, NO2, NMHC, and O3 levels, as well as specific dates and times.

## Tools
The dashboard was created using the following tools:
- **Microsoft Power BI**: For creating the visualizations and interactive elements.
  - Power Query
  - DAX 


## Data Preparation
Data preparation involved the following steps:
1. **Data Collection**: Extracting raw air quality data from the monitoring stations.
2. **Data Cleaning**: Removing duplicates, handling missing values, and ensuring data consistency.
3. **Data Transformation**: Aggregating data to monthly, weekly, and daily levels, and creating derived metrics such as average pollutant levels.
4. **Data Loading**: Importing the cleaned and transformed data into Power BI for visualization.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
EDA was conducted to understand the data better and uncover initial insights:
- **Descriptive Statistics**: Summary statistics for various pollutants.
- **Trend Analysis**: Identifying trends and patterns in air quality over time.
- **Correlation Analysis**: Exploring relationships between different pollutants and environmental conditions.
- **Distribution Analysis**: Examining the distribution of pollutant levels across different months and days.

## Findings from Data Analysis
1. **Monthly Pollutant Trends**: Pollutant levels generally vary with the seasons, with some pollutants peaking in specific months.
2. **Event Analysis**: Specific dates with extreme weather conditions show distinct patterns in pollutant levels.
3. **Pollutant Distribution**: Some pollutants, like NOx and NO2, show significant variations across different times of the year.
4. **Correlation with Weather**: Pollutant levels often correlate with specific weather conditions, such as humidity and temperature.

## Recommendations
Based on the data analysis, the following recommendations are made:
1. **Policy Implementation**: Implement stricter emission controls during months with high pollutant levels to improve air quality.
2. **Public Awareness**: Increase public awareness about air quality during months with poor air quality to reduce exposure.
3. **Monitoring and Research**: Continue monitoring and researching the correlation between weather conditions and pollutant levels to develop more effective pollution control strategies.
4. **Urban Planning**: Consider air quality data in urban planning and development to mitigate pollution in high-risk areas.

## Conclusion
The Beijing Air Quality Dashboard provides valuable insights into air quality across various dimensions. By utilizing the interactive visualizations and filters, stakeholders can make data-driven decisions to enhance environmental policies, improve air quality, and optimize overall public health strategies. Continuous monitoring and analysis of the dashboard will help in identifying new trends and opportunities for improvement.
